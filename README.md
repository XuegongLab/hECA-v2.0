This is a code repository for hECA v2.0.

The Python toolkit GeneSymbolUniform can be used to unify the feature space of scRNA-seq gene expression matrices into 42,117 genes. Code for cell type re-annotation for scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data can be found in [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15638912).

Usage_demo provides example scripts for converting h5ad files to other formats, and for correcting batch effects across different datasets.
